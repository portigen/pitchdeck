# PORTIGEN: Power To Go
## 5-Minute Pitch Script

### INTRODUCTION (30 sec)
Good afternoon. I'm [Name], founder of Telemonit, and today I'm excited to present PORTIGEN - our innovative edge computing power station that's breaking down barriers between humans and technology.

### THE PROBLEM (45 sec)
In today's connected world, the deployment of IoT and edge computing systems faces three critical challenges:

1. **Infrastructure Dependency**: Remote monitoring requires both reliable power AND computing capacity, but current solutions offer either power OR computing, not both.

2. **Latency Issues**: Cloud dependency creates high latency (50-200ms), making real-time applications impossible.

3. **Harsh Environment Challenges**: Outdoor deployments face temperature fluctuations (-20°C to +40°C) and weather conditions that standard equipment can't handle.

These challenges especially impact industries like industrial monitoring, smart cities, and agriculture, where on-site data processing is crucial but infrastructure is limited.

### OUR SOLUTION (60 sec)
PORTIGEN is an all-in-one autonomous outdoor power and edge computing station.

Our solution provides:
- 500Wh power capacity in a compact cylindrical design
- Ultra-low latency processing (<5ms) at the edge
- Rugged IP67 rated enclosure for all weather conditions
- Weeks of autonomous operation without maintenance
- Portable design (16kg with carrying strap)
- Voice interface for intuitive human-technology interaction

PORTIGEN enables predictive analytics, anomaly detection, local AI processing, and context-aware automation right where the data is generated - no cloud required.

We've already launched our commercial product in February 2024 (GTIN 5907433410909), moving beyond the prototype stage to a market-ready solution.

### MARKET OPPORTUNITY (45 sec)
The global edge computing market is projected to grow from $44.7 billion in 2022 to $101.3 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 17.8%.

Our initial target segments include:
- Environmental monitoring and smart city infrastructure
- Industrial IoT and predictive maintenance
- Agriculture and field monitoring
- Retail outdoor solutions

The market is expanding rapidly as organizations recognize the need for real-time processing at the edge, with particularly strong growth in Europe as industries digitally transform.

Our solution is highly scalable - the same core technology can be deployed across diverse use cases with minimal customization, enabling rapid expansion across sectors.

### COMPETITION & USP (45 sec)
While there are portable power stations like EcoFlow and Goal Zero, and edge computing solutions separately, PORTIGEN stands alone with:

| Feature | PORTIGEN | Competitors |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Power + Computing Integration | ✓ | ✗ |
| Edge Processing Latency | <5ms | 50-200ms |
| Deployment Time | Minutes | Hours/Days |
| Environmental Rating | IP67 | Varied |
| Voice Interface | ✓ | ✗ |

Our key differentiator is the unified approach - we're not just a power station with some computing capabilities. We've designed an integrated solution that brings compute power to where it's needed, with the durability for harsh environments and intelligence to process data locally.

We're protecting our IP around our integrated power management and edge computing architecture.

### BUSINESS MODEL (30 sec)
We offer PORTIGEN through two revenue streams:

1. **Hardware-as-a-Service**: Subscription model starting at €299/month per unit, eliminating upfront costs and certification burdens for customers.

2. **Direct Purchase**: For clients preferring ownership, priced at €3,990.

Both options include support services. Our go-to-market strategy focuses on:
- Building partnerships with system integrators
- Vertical-specific solutions with industry partners
- Direct sales to lighthouse customers

We've secured 50+ Letters of Intent for Q2 2024 deployments and expect first significant commercial sales in April 2024.

### TEAM (15 sec)
Our team is led by myself, Tom Sapletta, with expertise in industrial monitoring solutions and background in DevOps, hardware and software development. We've built a team combining expertise in power systems, edge computing, and AI integration.

### AI FOUNDERS FIT (30 sec)
We're an ideal fit for AI Founders because we're bringing AI capabilities to the edge, enabling real-time processing where traditional cloud-based models fail. During the 3-month program, we aim to:

1. Enhance our voice interface capabilities using specialized AI models for edge deployment
2. Develop industry-specific AI applications for key verticals
3. Refine our go-to-market strategy for European expansion

We're particularly looking for support in AI model optimization for edge deployment, connections to system integrators across Europe, and expertise in scaling hardware-as-a-service offerings.

### CLOSING (15 sec)
PORTIGEN is powering the edge of innovation - literally. We're not just providing a product but enabling a new paradigm where intelligence lives at the edge, where the data is created. 

Thank you for your attention. I welcome your questions.
