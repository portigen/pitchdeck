# PORTIGEN: Power To Go
## Edge Computing Power Station

### 1. The Problem

**For industrial IoT deployments, remote monitoring, and edge computing applications:**

- Current solutions force businesses to choose between power OR computing, not both
- Cloud dependency creates high latency (50-200ms) that's unacceptable for critical applications
- Harsh environments (-20°C to +40°C) challenge reliable deployment
- Fixed infrastructure requirements limit flexibility and increase costs
- Certification and compliance barriers delay market entry
- High upfront hardware costs hinder scalability

### 2. Our Solution: Portigen

**All-in-one autonomous outdoor power + edge computing station**

- 500Wh power capacity in a compact cylindrical design (60cm x 16cm, 16kg)
- Ultra-low latency edge computing (<5ms) for real-time processing
- IP67 weather-protected for harsh environments
- Weeks of autonomous operation without maintenance
- Hardware-as-a-Service model eliminates certification hurdles and upfront costs

**Development Stage:** Commercial product available since February 2025 (GTIN 5907433410909)

**Evidence of Product-Market Fit:**
- 2 construction firm pilot projects demonstrating real-world value
- 50+ Letters of Intent for Q2 2025 deployments
- Partnerships with system integrators already established

### 3. Market Size & Scalability

**Edge Computing Market:**
- $44.7 billion in 2022, projected to reach $101.3 billion by 2027 (17.8% CAGR)
- IoT deployments growing at 22% annually
- EU Industrial IoT market: €450 billion opportunity by 2025

**Scalability:**
- Hardware-as-a-Service model allows rapid scaling without manufacturing constraints
- Base technology adaptable to multiple market verticals
- Recurring revenue model ensures predictable growth
- Service can be deployed throughout EU without recertification

### 4. Competition & USP

**Competition:**
- Traditional power stations (EcoFlow, Jackery, Goal Zero) - lack computing capabilities
- Cloud service providers - high latency, require infrastructure
- Industrial edge computers - dependent on fixed power

**USPs:**
- Only solution combining power + edge computing in ONE system
- 60% lower energy consumption than hybrid cloud/edge systems
- <5ms latency vs. 50-200ms in cloud solutions
- IP67-rated with -20°C to +50°C operating range
- Hardware-as-a-Service model eliminates certification barriers
- Ready for deployment in minutes vs. hours/days for alternatives

**IP Strategy:** Patent application being prepared for our integrated power management and edge computing architecture
